          At Karavela, we are committed to advancing brain research through open

          accelerating discoveries, improving treatments for neurological and
          psychiatric disorders and generally understanding the brain better.

            Karavela is on a mission to collect one of the largest datasets of
            brain scans in the world. We believe that this data can help us
            better understand the human brain and develop new treatments for
            neurological and psychiatric disorders. Because this data is both
            very valuable and sensitive, we are committed to sharing it
            responsibly all the while protecting the privacy and rights of
            individuals who participate in our research.

            Brains are widely different from one person to another. Building
